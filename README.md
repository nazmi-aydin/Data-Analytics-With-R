# Analyzing The Android App Market on Google Play Store
This Exploratory Data Analytics Project aims to analyze “googleplaystore.csv” data which includes the Google Play Store apps with the help of RStudio. The “googleplaystore.csv” data includes 13 variables which are App Name, Category, Rating, Reviews, Size, Installs, Type, Price, Content.Rating, Genres, Last.Updated, Current.Ver, Android.Ver. To analyze the data, I find the appropriate needs such as one-variable and two-variable plots, an applicable model such as linear regression, logical regression or naive bayes. Before the analysis, with the help of tidyverse package, I did some data cleaning to interpret the plots and regression as in its correct way. To interpret the plots, I use ggplot2 package. My plots has based on Category, Reviews, Rating and App Types. The results and plots were stated below the report.
